# 4. Generate ANR Test App
I have added "anrtest" app to generate 3 different type of ANR in application. It will help you guys to debug ANR issue most easily. 
Use this app to generate ANR. Then Collect the logs (ANR trace, logcat logs, system logs) and analyse it. It will help you in ANR
debugging. For collecting logs you can follow [my blogs](http://saurabhsharma123k.blogspot.com/2018/03/know-android-logs-analysis.html)

# 5. Fill RAM Test application
I have added "fillram" app
   - to test device RAM size and current uses
   - by clicking "Fill Memory" button app start filling Device RAM with given rate (33 MB/10 sec)
   - Within few minute this app eat all your Device RAM and create LMK in Android BSP/Framework side
   - Once LMK triggered it kill all running app and services
   - This will be ideal case for your app behavior testing at low memory condition
